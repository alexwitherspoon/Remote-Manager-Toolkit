## Things to Keep in Mind

This folder is intended to contain any feedback that an employee may receive. This feedback can come from anywhere, and can be documented in a way that makes sense to reflect on for the individual and the manager. This can also hold more structured copies of performance reviews, or documentation of things people have said about you that would be helpful to have at hand. Reference and discuss these as they seem relevant to do so.

**I strongly suggest the employee keep a static copy in this feedback folder of performance reviews, and any general feedback. It will help promote healthy conversations and be available to reference later**

## How to Add Feedback Materials

Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), and add the materials relevant to the concept into the feedback folder. Organization is flexible, but the main intention is that the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) gives the Manager a chance to have a dialogue with the employee about those concepts. [Merge the Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/) when both parties have had a chance to discuss, and reference those ideas in goals, or status updates, or other relevant times so show progress or attempts to explore these ideas.
