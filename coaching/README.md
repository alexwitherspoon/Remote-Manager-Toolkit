## Things to Keep in Mind

This folder is intended to contain coaching materials that the employee encounters. These could come from the employee, a manager, a coach, company HR, a good book, or really anywhere - this is meant to contain links/copies of these materials so that they can be referenced, and discussed as they come up. Sometimes a coaching opportunity makes a small change of behavior or thought, but some can be profound - so use this as a way to discuss new ideas as they are encountered, as well as creating a history of ideas and concepts as they are encountered and applied to your life and career. 

**I strongly suggest the employee keep a static copy in this goals folder of important concepts or snippets from larger works that were influential. It will help promote healthy conversations and be available to reference later** 

## How to Add Coaching Materials

Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), and add the materials relevant to the concept into the coaching folder. Organization is flexible, but the main intention is that the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) gives the Manager a chance to have a dialogue with the employee about those concepts. [Merge the Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/) when both parties have had a chance to discuss, and reference those ideas in goals, or status updates, or other relevant times so show progress or attempts to explore these ideas.
