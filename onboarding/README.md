## Things to Keep in Mind

This folder is intended to contain all former, current, and desired Onboarding plans an individual has had and are trying to achieve as they are encountered. A new employee may have a single document, someone with more tenure may have more. The specific content of a onboarding plan often vary wildly from company to company and that is fine. - They may even exist in some central repository, but the point is to keep a copy here for easy frequent reference. Some plans are specific to company, team, role, or even specific responsibilities. For each of these onboarding plans, document them here, and ideally track progress towards completion using the GitHub Repo.

**I strongly suggest the employee keep a static copy in this onboarding folder. It will help promote healthy conversations and be available to remind us what the expectations are.** 

## Documenting Changes in Onboarding Plans

If an Onboarding Plan has a very minor change, perhaps the right thing to do is create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) documenting that change to the existing onboarding plan file, and discuss the change and confirm with the manager and employee.

For a larger change, such a new set of responsibilities, or membership to a new team with different onboarding, I'd suggest creating a new file and creating a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for discussion, so that the employee can track the progress and changing expecations they are learning. I also suggest that if the employee has a goal in mind as a future that may require onboarding, they should document that in this folder and reference it as needed to prepare.
