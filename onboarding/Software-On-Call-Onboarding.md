# Things to Keep in Mind

This is an example of an onboarding plan entering based on a responsibility. This is a neat way to break out specific responsibilities that may not fit perfectly with a standard role, or may be additional responsibilities a person has taken on. This is a way to call out those specific requirements. I have seen companies have a series of responsibilities separately outlined, and then combined to create roles.
