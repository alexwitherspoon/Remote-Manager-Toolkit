## Purpose & Intent

As a manager, I want you to feel empowered to not just do the job today, but also plan and document your career so I can help you grow and be successful in work and in life. My goal is to help you be a great staff member here, but also set you up for success wherever your career takes you. Let's use this space to figure out how we will work together to make this happen. Look at everything in this document as a strong suggestion, but not an edict, or precise and perfect process - if the process below isn't working, let's find a new way to do it that works for both of us. 

If you ever change managers, this repo is *your* repo, and you can bring it with you to your next manager to help give you more continuity if you like. Since it is stored in a Git repo, you can keep a private copy with you at all times, and any changes will be tracked to ensure an accurate record.

## Monthly Reviews & Goal Setting

One meeting per month will be set aside to do a lightweight dedicated conversation about goals, critical feedback, and making sure that manager and staff are aligned status and progress. These should help build up to annual performance reviews and help me better advocate for you. 

## 1-1 Asynchronous
Create an issue weekly, add content whenever things come to mind, and review when possible during 1-1 Sync meetings. It's perfectly fine to say 'none' to any of these. 

### Basic Issue Template
> * What should we celebrate?
> * What are large/long lived blockers?
> * Any large changes, PTO or Leave coming up?
> * How do you feel about current work/situation?
> * Open Conversation for Social/Professional Development
>

## 1-1 Synchronous

Go over any Async content in the issue, add any additional detail and either end early, or discuss any topic the staff wants to talk about - it's their meeting.

### Weekly 1-1 Agenda Calendar Content

> **Meeting Purpose**
> * Private 1-1 - safe space.
> * Weekly recurring meeting.
> * Booked for one quarter, at least each quarter retro the process and make changes as needed.
> * Move the meeting if there is a conflict, if timing doesn't work for a synchronous meeting, send an update via Issue/DM/Email with at minimum the responses for the outcomes section below.
> * If the meeting can end early, do so, but use the time when you need it.
> * Schedule deep dives into specific topic driven meetings if we don't have time in the general 1-1 to cover it.
