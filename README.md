# Critical Privacy Update - 11-23-2019

One of the critical components of one on one coaching is creating private and safe spaces to explore growth, failure, and the full human experience of the situations encountered. - This critical point of privacy allows for deeply impactful conversations, and is a fundamental component ethically, and professionally to maintain the integrity of that honest and safe space to collaborate inside. While I was very optimistic to experiment with this framework using a new tool in Git hosted on GitHub and while there have been many positives - I have come to learn that the kind of privacy required for this tool to be effective is not possible on the GitHub platform, nor was it designed for this purpose in mind even if the content is within a private repository. It can not be guaranteed that this information will not be seen by others without record, reason or cause to see it, and for that reason I can no longer suggest using this framework on GitHub for this kind of sensitive information. I am glad the experiment could happen, and I learned a lot in the process, and I am thankful for those that helped me develop, test, and evolve this over time. I still stand by the content, and it's effectiveness has worked in many instances for me in my career of managing and coaching others so I will leave the content on GitHub in hopes of sharing it, but I can no longer recommend utilizing this framework, or works like it on GitHub with real human data or sensitive information.

Please link, or copy content here describing clearly and concisely the responsibilities for the current role. When these change, make a PR and discuss those changes. 

## Purpose & Intent

As a manager, I want you to feel empowered to not just do the job today, but also plan and document your career so I can help you grow and be successful in work and in life. My goal is to help you be a great staff member here, but also set you up for success wherever your career takes you. Let's use this space to figure out how we will work together to make this happen. Look at everything in this document as a strong suggestion, but not an edict, or precise and perfect process - if the process below isn't working, let's find a new way to do it that works for both of us. 

If you ever change managers, this repo is *your* repo, and you can bring it with you to your next manager to help give you more continuity if you like. Since it is stored in a Git repo, you can keep a private copy with you at all times, and any changes will be tracked to ensure an accurate record.

## Monthly Reviews & Goal Setting

One meeting per month will be set aside to do a lightweight dedicated conversation about goals, critical feedback, and making sure that manager and staff are aligned status and progress. These should help build up to annual performance reviews and help me better advocate for you. 

## 1-1 Asynchronous
Create an issue weekly, add content whenever things come to mind, and review when possible during 1-1 Sync meetings. It's perfectly fine to say 'none' to any of these. 

### Basic Issue Template
> * What should we celebrate?
> * What are large/long lived blockers?
> * Any large changes, PTO or Leave coming up?
> * How do you feel about current work/situation?
> * Open Conversation for Social/Professional Development
> 
> /cc @github_username

## 1-1 Synchronous

Go over any Async content in the issue, add any additional detail and either end early, or discuss any topic the staff wants to talk about - it's their meeting.

### Weekly 1-1 Agenda Calendar Content

> **Meeting Purpose**
> * Private 1-1 - safe space.

> * Schedule deep dives into specific topic driven meetings if we don't have time in the general 1-1 to cover it.
