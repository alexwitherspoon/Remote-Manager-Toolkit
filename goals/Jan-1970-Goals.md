## Things to Keep in Mind
The template outlines some general questions to ask and define so we can look at a monthly cadence to evaluate where you are, where you want to go, and the steps we are taking to get there. There are no 'wrong' goals, but here are definitely more effective goals - they tend to include [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) aspects, and try to make iterative steps towards better technical, interpersonal, leadership, communication, and happiness towards your career. Goals should be a stretch, and failing to meet some of them should be just fine - try to understand why, and use that to plan better goals in the next iteration. Treat the Career Trajectory like a vision statement, and our monthly goals should support maintaining, or achieving that vision.

## Career Trajectory
Where do you want to be by the end of this year? 

**Example:** I enjoy my position, and my role, I like what I am doing right now. I'd like to continue improving skills, and getting chances to work with others to mentor and learn from.

**Example:** I'd like to change roles, or get to a higher level in my role, and I'd like to get opportunities to take on stretch projects, and define some plans to increase my skills, and get the chance to use those skills at work. 

**Example:** I am not sure, maybe we can talk about it?

### Emotional Labor and Context
_Please be sure to note any additional emotional labor that has happened throughout the month. These also help us remember what was happening this month that made work easier or harder than it should have been when we reference this in the future._

## Critical Feedback from Manager
### Manager Monthly Assessment
Regularly discuss the manager's perception of performance, discuss if this ever seems off, and discuss how to improve it.

_Based on your performance in relation to your responsibilities, you are currently:_ **[exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet]**

### Manager Monthy Critical Improvements

_What areas need critical improvement? - If none are required, this will be marked as "No areas need improvement at this time." - There should be no negative stigma with something showing up on this list, the focus should be on how we resolve and move on from issues as they come up. I am excited to help an employee through a challenge, but I do not want to see anyone persistantly over time underperforming because we haven't been able to overcome the challnges that come up._
