## Things to Keep in Mind

This folder is meant to hold all monthly goal setting documents. Each document should represent an iteration of the process, and be freshly created with an open [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to contain all conversation and document progress made. There is an example [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) demonstrating this idea named "[Create Oct-2018-Goals.md](https://github.com/alexwitherspoon/Remote-Manager-Toolkit/pull/2)" 

### Why this Structure and Cadence?
Far too often I see minimal or no emphasis on coaching, alignment, or said another way growth of our employees. This is meant to help frame positive conversations about improvement, just like a coach would for a professional athlete. This should not be focused on punishment, or used to defeat employees, but instead help safely challenge them to grow, be healthy, and be happy.

Other times as is often common practice individuals are given yearly reviews, and halfway check-ins. Depending on the industry, this can be the wrong iteration.

I'd strongly suggest considering a more Outcome based goal setting mindset, where the Outcome for a year is tightly coupled with conversations about desired career trajectory and monthly goals are established and pursued to help achieve that outcome.

It's very difficult for humans to stay true to a annual improvement plan, but it's much easier to make a series of improvements month over month.

Additionally, the frequent critical feedback gives more fidelity, and opportunity for improvement. Frequent transparent conversations help make more powerful changes, and help promote the strongest growth possible.
