## Things to Keep in Mind
This folder is intended to contain all former, current, and desired Roles an individual has had and are trying to achieve as they are encountered. A new employee may have a single document, someone with more tenure may have more. The specific content of a Roles and Responsibilities document often vary wildly from company to company and that is fine. - They may even exist in some central repository, but the point is to keep a copy here for easy frequent reference. 

**I strongly suggest the employee keep a static copy in this role's folder. It will help promote healthy conversations and be available to remind us what the expectations are.** 

## Documenting Changes in Role or Responsibilities

If a role has a very minor change, perhaps the right thing to do is create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) documenting that change to the existing role file, and discuss the change and confirm with the manager and employee.

For a larger change, or a level change, I'd suggest creating a new file and creating a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for discussion, so that the employee can track the progress and changing roles and responsibilities they have taken on. I also suggest that if the employee has a role in mind as a future goal, they should document that in this folder and use that to reference to frame the difference between the current roles and responsibilities and the desired role and responsibility.
