## Things to Keep in Mind
Below is just a rough example of a job I personally held, and the job description and role and responsibilities it entailed. This was for a Senior Director of Software Engineering overlooking a department of a larger business.

By documenting this here, in a repo, I can reference, improve, and make sure clear expectations are set at hiring, and throughout my job cycle. When I inevitably transition/leave this becomes incredibly useful to define what responsibilities should be backfilled or distributed.
