# Remote-Manager-Toolkit
https://github.com/alexwitherspoon/Remote-Manager-Toolkit

This is a repo with templates, examples, and things that could be copied, [cloned](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), [forked](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and used to manage remote teams with elements of real-time and [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication) approaches.

I created this repo not to be an exhaustive and perfect resource, but instead as a great starter to suggest the scope and kinds of things that need to be minimally viable and considered. I often talk about methods and process for managing remote teams, and many of these conversations quickly become complex, but these approaches in the repo should be fairly universal, or the basis for creating your own method for managing. As a manager, I keep a template version of my methods and processes available so staff can understand my approach, and my boss, and the company can audit my processes any time they like.

> Put Simply - I want to minimize secrets, surprises, and increase transparency, and consistency.
